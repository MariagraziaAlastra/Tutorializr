Tutorializr
===========

Tutorializr is an editor for tutorials (right now it's possible to create only HTML + CSS tutorials). It's still in alpha, many more features to come!

TODO list (remainder for myself) :
----------------------------------

* Add Media Queries;
* Make the welcoming modal dialog unskippable;
* Create a better favicon;
* Implement code highliter;
* Integrate some WYSIWYG editor (or just some basic functionalities) 
in the textareas dedicated to the lesson explanation;
* Save changes to the code when going back to previous lessons;
* Add social buttons;
* Create more templates;
* Add more content to the home page.
