Tutorializr
===========

Tutorializr is a tutorial maker (only HTML + CSS tutorials can be created, right now). It's still in alpha, many more features to come!

TODO list (reminder for myself) :
----------------------------------

* Add Media Queries;
* Create a better favicon;
* Implement code highlighter;
* Integrate some WYSIWYG editor (or just some basic functionalities) 
in the textareas dedicated to the lesson explanation;
* Add social buttons;
* Create more templates;
* Add more content to the home page.
