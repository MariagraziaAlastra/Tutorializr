Tutorializr
===========

Tutorializr is a tutorial maker (only HTML + CSS tutorials can be created, right now). It's still in alpha, many more features to come!

**[Try the latest version here!](http://mariagraziaalastra.github.io/Tutorializr/editor.html)**

Just follow the instructions, upload or write the code for your lessons, add some explanations and when you're finished you will get the complete code in a ready-to-upload folder for your website!

(**NB:** it won't work in locale; if you want to try the tutorial on your machine before uploading it to your website you must have a server installed on it, and of course you must put the downloaded tutorial in the appropriate folder, first.)

TODO list (reminder for myself) :
----------------------------------

* Implement code highlighter --> work in progress
* Create a better favicon
* Integrate some WYSIWYG editor (or just some basic functionalities) 
in the textareas dedicated to the lesson explanation
* Add social buttons
* Create more templates
* Add more content to the home page
